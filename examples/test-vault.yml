# Example Ansible vault content for testing
# This file demonstrates how to use the ansible-vault plugin

---
# Plain text section
database_host: "db.example.com"
database_port: 5432

# This section below should be encrypted with ansible-vault
# Select the lines and use <leader>ve to encrypt them
database_username: "admin"
database_password: "super_secret_password"
api_key: "abc123xyz789"

# Mixed content file - you can encrypt only sensitive parts
app_name: "my-app"
app_version: "1.0.0"

# To test the plugin:
# 1. Select the sensitive lines above (database_username, database_password, api_key)
# 2. Press <leader>ve to encrypt them
# 3. Use <leader>vd to decrypt them back
# 4. Use <leader>vv to view encrypted content without modifying the file
# 5. Use :VaultEncryptFile to encrypt the entire file
# 6. Use :VaultEditFile to safely edit encrypted files
