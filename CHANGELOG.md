## [1.1.2] - 2025-07-30

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Fixed indentation loss in nested YAML structures**
  - Cursor-based operations (`<leader>vc`) now preserve original YAML indentation
  - Fixed `decrypt_yaml_value()` and `encrypt_yaml_value()` to maintain leading whitespace
  - Nested structures like `environments.production.database.password` maintain proper spacing
- **Fixed invalid YAML output due to comment spacing**
  - Added `ensure_comment_spacing()` helper to guarantee proper spacing before `#` comments
  - All reconstruction functions now ensure at least one space before inline comments
  - Prevents invalid YAML like `password: "value"#comment` â†’ generates `password: "value" #comment`
- **Improved vault encryption detection logic**
  - `smart_at_cursor()` now correctly detects encryption status of YAML values (not entire structures)
  - Fixed false positives where `!vault` indicator in structure was mistaken for encrypted content
  - Cursor-based encrypt/decrypt now works reliably with nested vault content

### Enhanced
- Updated nested examples file with comprehensive test cases for indentation and comment preservation
- Added comment spacing validation examples to demonstrate proper YAML formatting

## [1.1.1] - 2025-07-29

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: VaultEditFile now correctly saves files encrypted**
  - Fixed `encrypt_on_save()` to use file-based encryption instead of stdin/stdout
  - File is now properly encrypted in place and reloaded
  - Auto-command is properly cleaned up after encryption
- **CRITICAL: Fixed <leader>vc and all decrypt operations**
  - Fixed stdin issue in `execute_vault_command` that broke all decrypt functions
  - Replaced `jobstart` with `vim.fn.system()` for proper stdin/stdout handling
  - Fixed: `M.decrypt()`, `M.decrypt_prompt()`, `M.decrypt_operator()`, `M.decrypt_yaml_value()`
  - Fixed: `M.encrypt()`, `M.encrypt_operator()`
  - Cursor-based operations (`<leader>vc`) now work correctly again

### Changed
- **VaultEditFile behavior: save-triggered encryption**
  - `:VaultEditFile` decrypts buffer content while file stays encrypted on disk
  - `:w` encrypts current buffer content to disk but keeps buffer decrypted
  - No continuous auto-encryption - only encrypts when explicitly saving
  - Perfect for controlled editing with security when ready
  - Added `:VaultStopAutoEncrypt` to stop save-triggered encryption

## [1.1.0] - 2025-07-29

### Added
- **YAML-aware encryption/decryption** - Smart handling of key-value pairs
- `:VaultEncryptValue` / `:VaultDecryptValue` - Encrypt/decrypt only YAML values

- New key mappings for YAML-specific operations
- Enhanced YAML parsing with support for quoted/unquoted values and comments
- Smart reconstruction of YAML lines preserving structure

### Changed
- Default `<leader>ve` and `<leader>vd` now use smart mode (auto-detects YAML)
- Added `<leader>vev` / `<leader>vdv` for YAML value-only operations
- Added `<leader>vef` / `<leader>vdf` for full-selection operations

## [1.0.3] - 2025-07-29
